									<h1>Eboni Brown</h1>
									
								</header>
								<p>My name is Eboni and I am data analyst with a passion for harnessing the power of data to drive insights and informed
									decision-making. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, SQL, and VBA, I bring a versatile
									skill set to the table, enabling me to dive deep into data analysis and visualization</p>
								<p>I've honed my skills in various tools and packages, including pandas, matplotlib, numpy, Google Sheets and Tableau, to
								transform raw data into actionable insights. I'm driven by a commitment to efficiency and automation, exemplified by my
								successful implementation of VBA/macros to streamline processes, significantly reducing processing times and eliminating
								errors.</p>

								<p>My experience as a Corporate Trust Operations Specialist at Wilmington Trust has equipped me with a meticulous eye for
								detail and a knack for problem-solving.</p>
								<p>I'm also an excellent communicator and collaborator, having worked closely with cross-functional teams to achieve project
								goals. My ability to convey complex data findings through data storytelling has proven invaluable in driving informed
								decision-making.</p>
								<p>In addition to my professional experience, I've continually expanded my skill set, earning certifications such as the
								Data Analyst Associate by DataCamp and actively participating in Data Analytics and Visualization Virtual Experiences. I
								am currently continuing to expand my data analytics knowledge through the American Dream Academy where I am working
								towards completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.</p>
								<p>My educational background includes a Data Science Bootcamp from Coding Dojo, a degree in Economics from the University
								of Delaware, and coursework in Mathematics from Howard University.</p>
								<p>As a data enthusiast, I'm excited to take on new challenges and contribute my expertise to data-driven endeavors.
								Connect with me via email at ebonibrown2017@gmail.com or find me on LinkedIn and GitHub to explore potential
								collaborations and opportunities.</p>
